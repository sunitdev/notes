    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a powerful, flexible, and scalable general-purpose database. It combines the ability to scale out with features such as secondary indexes, range queries, sorting, aggregations, and geospatial indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB was made for high scalability. It does so by providing features like sharding, replication etc out of the box. It solve the scalability problems of relational database, by sacrificing some relational database principles and offloading the processing to the client side code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are a bunch of features of MongoDB. It provides all of these features without sacrificing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ease of use\n",
    "    MongoDB is a document based database.A document-oriented database replaces the concept of a \"row\" with a more flexible model, the \"document.\". Unlike rows, documents don't have a fixed structure so developer can add any key-value pair at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy Scaling\n",
    "    MongoDB was build with scalability in mind. The document driven model help a lot in horizontal scaling and MongoDB provides features such as sharding, replica etc out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing\n",
    "    MongoDB supports generic secondary indexes, allowing a variety of fast queries, and provides unique, compound, geospatial, and full-text indexing capabilities as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregation\n",
    "    MongoDB supports an \"aggregation pipeline\" that allows you to build complex aggregations from simple pieces and allow the database to optimize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Special collection types\n",
    "    MongoDB supports time-to-live collections for data that should expire at a certain time, such as sessions. It also supports fixed-size collections, which are useful for holding recent data, such as logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- File storage\n",
    "    MongoDB supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we go through the basics of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB works by providing a service called as mongod. This service is provides all the database operations. All of the MongoDB client (eg: mongo shell) connect to this service and perform operations when required by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation on Ubuntu follow this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Config file of mongod is at ```/etc/mongod.conf```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documents\n",
    "At the heart of MongoDB is the document: an ordered set of keys with associated values. An example of a document is as below."
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {
    "kernel": "typescript"
   },
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "{\n",
    "    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n",
    "    \"key2\": 2,\n",
    "    \"key3\": [\"abc\", \"pqr\", 3]\n",
    "}"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {
    "kernel": "typescript"
   },
   "source": [
    "Things to note.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keys must not contain the character the null character. It is used to signify the end of a key.\n",
    "- Key name is case-sensitive, ```Key1``` and ```key1``` are different.\n",
    "- Key/value pairs in documents are ordered: ```{\"x\" : 1, \"y\" : 2}``` is not the same as {\"y\" : 2, \"x\" : 1} .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection is a group of documents. If a document is the MongoDB analog of a row in a relational database, then a collection can be thought of as the analog to a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections have dynamic schema's. This means that the documents within a single collection can have any number of different \"shapes\" For example, both of the following documents could be stored in a single collection:"
   ]
  },

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {
    "kernel": "typescript"
   },
   "source": [
    "Things to note\n",
    "- One convention for organizing collections is to use namespaced sub collections separated by the ``.`` (dot) character. For example, an application containing a ```blog``` might have a collection named ```blog.posts``` and a separate collection named ```blog.authors```. This is for organizational purposes only-there is no relationship between the ```blog``` collection (it doesn't even have to exist) and its \"children\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to grouping documents by collection, MongoDB groups collections into databases. A single instance of MongoDB can host several databases, each grouping together zero or more collections. A database has its own permissions, and each database is stored in separate files on disk. A good rule of thumb is to store all data for a single application in the same database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note\n",
    "- A database name cannot contain any of these characters: /, , ., \" , *, <, >, :, |, ?, \\$, (a single space), or the null character. Basically, stick with alphanumeric ASCII.\n",
    "- Database names are case-sensitive\n",
    "- Database names are limited to a maximum of 64 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing Database\n",
    "There are also several reserved database names, which you can access but which have special semantics. These are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```admin```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the **root** database, in terms of authentication. If a user is added to the ```admin``` database, the user automatically inherits permissions for all databases. There are also certain server-wide commands that can be run only from the ```admin``` database, such as listing all of the databases or shutting down the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```local```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This database will never be replicated and can be used to store any collections that should be local to a single server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```config```\n",
    "\n",
    "    When MongoDB is being used in a sharded setup , it uses the config database to store information about the shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Data Type\n",
    "Following data types for values are supported by mongodb.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **null**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Null can be used to repesent both a null value and a nonexistent field."

    "- GridFS will leverage any existing replication or autosharding that we've set up for MongoDB, so getting failover and scale-out for file storage is easier.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Slower performance: accessing files from MongoDB will not be as fast as going directly through the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can only modify documents by deleting them and resaving the whole thing. MongoDB stores files as multiple documents so it cannot lock all of the chunks in a file at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working With GridFS\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS generally provides following method, list (List all files), delete (Delete a specific file), search (Search for a file), put (Add a file from filesystem), get (Save file from GridFS to filesystem).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS is a lightweight specification for storing files that is built on top of normal MongoDB documents. The MongoDB server actually does almost nothing to “special-case” the handling of GridFS requests; all the work is handled by the client-side drivers and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind GridFS is that we can store large files by splitting them up into chunks and storing each chunk as a separate document. Because MongoDB supports storing binary data in documents, we can keep storage overhead for chunks to a minimum. In addition to storing each chunk of a file, we store a single document that groups the chunks together and contains metadata about the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunks for GridFS are stored in their own collection. By default chunks will use the collection ```fs.chunks```, but this can be overridden. Within the chunks collection the structure of the individual documents is pretty simple."
