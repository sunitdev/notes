    "Here, class `Child` inherits from two classes `ParentA` and `ParentB` and each of them have a method named `say_hello()`. So when we called `say_hello` on an instance of `Child` class which method should get resolved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python solves this ambiguity with something called as **Method Resolution Operator** or **MRO**. Which is basically a list of classes in order of precedence of method resolution. The first class in the list which contains the required method will be called. As seen from the example above, class `ParentA` is first in the list which contains the said method so the `say_hello` of `ParentA` is called.\n",

    "\n",
    "C3 was introduced in python from the version 2.3. Before C3 depth first, left to right traversal was used as a way to find the mro sequence. The problem with depth first, left to right was that the algorithm was not monotonic. A MRO is monotonic when the following is true: if C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of C, then C1 precedes C2 in the linearization of any subclass of C. Otherwise, the innocuous operation of deriving a new class could change the resolution order of methods, potentially introducing very subtle bugs. Thus C3 was introduced which provided monotonic mro for any complex class hierarchy.\n",

    "2) **Head**: Head is the first element of any list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Tail**: Tail is part of list which is left after removing the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Good Head**: A Good head is a head which only appears on the start of the list but not in the between or end of the list.\n",
