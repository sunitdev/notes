    "# Logarithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know that exponent is something raise to something. For example $5^3=5*5*5=125$ or $5^{-2}=\\frac{1}{5^2}=\\frac{1}{25}=0.04$. Exponent is generally written as $x^a=y$. Where $x$ is called the **base** and **a** is called the exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithms or simply **log** is opposite of exponent. Continuing the above definition, log will be defined as follows $log_x(y)=a$. Read as \"log of $y$ to the base $x$ is $a$\". So basically the question we are asking with logarithm is, for what number if i raise $x$ to will give me $y$. To complete our definition we show the log of the examples we took. $log_5(125)=3$ and $log_5(0.04)=-2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **The logarithm of a nonzero and nonnegative number wherein the base is the number itself is always equal to $1$.** \n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(b)=1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which make sense as log of any number will itself will result in $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The logarithm of $1$ with any values of $b$ ( $b$ is a positive number but $b \\neq 1$) is always equal to zero.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(1)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because any number raise to zero will yield $1$ so $log$ of any $base$ with $1$ is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The logarithm of a negative number to any base is undefined.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(-x)=\\text{undefined}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As exponent will never yield a negative number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **The logarithm of zero to any base is undefined.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(0)=\\text{undefined}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because no exponent and result in $0$ as the answer. \n",

    "## Rules of logarithm.\n",

    "# Permutation And Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting. There are multiple ways for counting number of element. Permutation and combination are example of one them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permutation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a list of alphabets from A-Z, which are in total 26 characters. And we are to selected 5 characters from the list. Permutation gives us the total number of combination of 5 characters that we can make from the list of all 26 characters. Permutation can be defined as picking up the number of item from a large pool of items where the position of the items matter.Thus \"ABCD\" is different from \"BACD\", both of them consists of same characters but the position of \"A\" and \"B\" are different so they are considered to be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two formula depending upon where we are allow the repeat the selected items while choosing new item or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "If repetition is allowed then we can that we have 26 chooses for our first character and 26 for our second and so and so forth. So the total number of permutation possible with repetition can be given as.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 26\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formulate the definition as follows. Let $n$ be the total number of items available for selection and let $r$ be the number of items we want to make combinations of, so the formula can be written as.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n^r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "If repetition is not allowed. Then for our first character we have 26 choices and then 25 for second and 24 for third etc. So number of permutation without repetition is.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the above expression as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{26!}{21!} = \\frac{26!}{(26 - 5)!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can write a general formula for permutation as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination is same as permutation but here the position of the element does not matter. We can think for combination as creating a number of smaller sub set from a bigger set. Thus \"ABCD\" is same as \"BACD\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know the formula for permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But it will have same set of elements repeated $r!$ times. Because we have $r$ possibility for first element, $(r-1)$ possibility for second element and so on. So to get the number of combinations possible we would simply divide the number of permutation by $r!$. Thus giving us the formula for combinations as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{n!}{r! (n-r)!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination is denoted by $\\binom{n}{r}$. Thus,\n",
    "\n",
