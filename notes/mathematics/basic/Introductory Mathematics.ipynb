    "# Logarithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know that exponent is something raise to something. For example $5^3=5*5*5=125$ or $5^{-2}=\\frac{1}{5^2}=\\frac{1}{25}=0.04$. Exponent is generally written as $x^a=y$. Where $x$ is called the **base** and **a** is called the exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithms or simply **log** is opposite of exponent. Continuing the above definition, log will be defined as follows $log_x(y)=a$. Read as \"log of $y$ to the base $x$ is $a$\". So basically the question we are asking with logarithm is, for what number if i raise $x$ to will give me $y$. To complete our definition we show the log of the examples we took. $log_5(125)=3$ and $log_5(0.04)=-2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **The logarithm of a nonzero and nonnegative number wherein the base is the number itself is always equal to $1$.** \n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(b)=1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which make sense as log of any number will itself will result in $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The logarithm of $1$ with any values of $b$ ( $b$ is a positive number but $b \\neq 1$) is always equal to zero.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(1)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because any number raise to zero will yield $1$ so $log$ of any $base$ with $1$ is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The logarithm of a negative number to any base is undefined.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(-x)=\\text{undefined}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As exponent will never yield a negative number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **The logarithm of zero to any base is undefined.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_b(0)=\\text{undefined}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because no exponent and result in $0$ as the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm of product of numbers is the sum of logarithm of individual numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "log_b(M.N) = log_b(M) + log_b(N)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotient Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm of the quotient of numbers is the difference of the logarithm of individual numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "log_b\\left (\\frac{M}{N} \\right ) = log_b(M) - log_b(N)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm of an exponential number is the exponent times the logarithm of the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "log_b(M^k) = k \\; log_b(M)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log of Exponent Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm of an exponential number where its base is the same as the base of the log equals the exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "log_b(b^k) = k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponent of Log Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising the logarithm of a number by its base equals the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b^{log_b(k)} = k\n",
