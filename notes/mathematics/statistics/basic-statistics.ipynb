    "# Average/ Median / Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset we can calculate some charactheris of the dataset which act as an indicator of the dataset givining us the idea of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Average\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically average is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Average is a number which when replaced with with other number in a dataset yields the same sum as the sum of the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have following set $X=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ of $n$ number where $n=5$ in this case, then the average or mean denoted by $\\bar{X}$, is a number where the following holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 &= \\bar{X} + \\bar{X} +\\bar{X} +\\bar{X} +\\bar{X} \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{x=i}^n x_i &= \\sum_{x=i}^n \\bar{X} \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{x=i}^n x_i &= n * \\bar{X} \\\\\n",
    "\\bar{X} &= \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus giving us the formula for the average. Which is the sum of number of elements divided by the number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Median\n",
    "\n",
    "Median of the dataset is the kind of center point or the center of gravity of the dataset. For the set $X=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. The median would be $3$ as it is in between the set. If the number of element in the dataset are even we take the average of the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So more formally,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Median Index} =\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{n+1}{2} & \\text{if n is odd} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n+1}{2}}{2} & \\text{if n is even} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode is the most frequently occurring element in the dataset. For example in the set $X=\\{1,2,2,2,3,3,4\\}$. \"$2$\" is the mode as the has the most frequency of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variance and Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Average gives us the central tendency of the data. But it does not tells us how far the data is spread in the dataset. Consider following two sets. $X=\\{ 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 \\}$ and $Y=\\{1, 5, 9, 17, 83\\}$ both of the have the same average $\\bar{X}=23$ and $\\bar{Y}=23$. But $X$ is very less spread out then $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate how spread the data is from the mean we use variance denoted by $(\\delta^2)$. Variance is calculate by taking the sum of square of difference between each item and the mean divided by the total number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{X})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus for our example variance of $X$ is.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left ( (21 - 23) ^2 + (22 - 23)^2 + (23 - 23)^2 + (24 - 23)^2 + (25 - 23)^2 \\right ) = 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly of $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta^2 = \\frac{1}{5} \\left ( (1 - 23) ^2 + (5 - 23)^2 + (9 - 23)^2 + (17 - 23)^2 + (83 - 23)^2 \\right ) = 928\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see $Y$ has very high variance as it is spread a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is good for finding the spread, but in calculating the variance we square the terms thus converting unit to square units (cm to cm<sup>2</sup>). Thus we take square root of variance to get what is called is standard deviation (denoted by $\\delta$) which is in the same unit as that of original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta = \\sqrt{\\delta^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data has a normal distribution. $68\\%$ of data will lie between $\\bar{X} \\pm \\delta$, $95\\%$ of data will lie between $\\bar{X} \\pm 2\\delta$ and $99.7\\%$ of data will lie between $\\bar{X} \\pm 3\\delta$.\n"
