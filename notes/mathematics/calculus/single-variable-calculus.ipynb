    "**Calculus** word comes latin word *calculus* which means *small pebble*. Calculus is a study of continuous change, it is study of how to divide an larger area into smaller parts (pebble) and then use them as a whole to calculate the overall area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus is divided into two parts, **Differential Calculus**, which deal is rate of change of entities and **Integral Calculus** which deals with finding area under a curve. Both of these are connected to each other by a beautiful theorem called the **fundamental theorem of calculus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall calculus theorem and computations can be performed on multiple variables, In this notes we will only concern ourselves with two variable namely $X$ and $Y$. This smaller subsection of calculus in which we consider only one variable at a time is called **Single Variable Calculus**."
